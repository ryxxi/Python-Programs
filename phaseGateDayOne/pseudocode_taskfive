1. Create 2 variables called current_day and future_day
2. Initialise both of them to an empty String
3. Define function get_current_day with parameter day
   a. Create a match case for day
      i. Case 0: current_day = "Sunday"
      ii. Case 1: current_day = "Monday"
      iii. Case 2: current_day = "Tuesday"
      iv. Case 3: current_day = "Wednesday"
      v. Case 4: current_day = "Thursday"
      vi. Case 5: current_day = "Friday"
      vii. Case 6: current_day = "Saturday"
   b. return current_day
4. Define function get_future_day with parameter day
   if day > 6, assign the remainder of day % 7 to day
   b. Create a match case for day
      i. Case 0: current_day = "Sunday"
      ii. Case 1: current_day = "Monday"
      iii. Case 2: current_day = "Tuesday"
      iv. Case 3: current_day = "Wednesday"
      v. Case 4: current_day = "Thursday"
      vi. Case 5: current_day = "Friday"
      vii. Case 6: current_day = "Saturday"
   c. return current_day
5. Prompt a user to enter today's day
6. Collect value and store as day
7. If day only consists of digits, cast day to type int
8. Else, display "Invalid input"
9. Prompt a user to enter number of days since today
10. Collect value and store as elapsed
11. If elapsed only consists of digits, cast elapsed to type int
12. Else, display "Invalid input"
13. Call get_current_day with argument day
14. Display "Today is (get_current_day(day))"
15. Increment day by elapsed
16. Call get_future_day with argument day
17. Display "Future day is (get_future_day(day))"
